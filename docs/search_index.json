Q2: What is the effect of inclusion on overall school attendance and chronic absenteeism in NYC public schools? 2.1 Question 1 2.1.1 Data Overview Using OpenData NYC, we pull aggregate K-8 attendance records and socio-economic variables for all 1125 public schools.

However, five covariates generally associated with higher absenteeism are predictive of both the treatment and the outcome, making them confounders. \\[ \\begin{align} ChronicAbsenteeism = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1Treatment + \\beta_2ENI+ \\beta_3PercentBlack+\\beta_4PercentSWD + \\\\ \\beta_5PercentPoverty +\\beta_6PercentPoverty+ BoroughFixedEffects + \\epsilon \\end{align} \\] Table 2.4: Chronic Absenteeism ~ Treatment + Covariates Predictor B SE t p (Intercept) 1.78 1.692 1.05 0.293 treatment -1.88 0.684 -2.75 0.006 TotalEnrollment 0.00 0.001 -3.97 0.000 ENI 43.59 3.981 10.95 0.000 PercentBlack 16.62 1.068 15.56 0.000 PercentSWD 36.88 4.501 8.19 0.000 PercentPoverty -20.36 3.960 -5.14 0.000 factor(borough)Brooklyn -3.76 0.683 -5.51 0.000 factor(borough)Manhattan -2.58 0.831 -3.10 0.002 factor(borough)Queens -2.62 0.788 -3.33 0.001 factor(borough)Staten Island 1.22 1.248 0.98 0.330 \\[ \\begin{align} Treatment = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1TotalEnrollment + \\beta_2ENI+ \\beta_3PercentBlack+\\beta_4PercentSWD + \\\\ \\beta_5PercentPoverty + BoroughFixedEffects + \\epsilon \\end{align} \\] Table 2.5: Treatment ~ Covariates Predictor B SE t p (Intercept) 1.19 0.065 18.27 0.000 TotalEnrollment 0.00 0.000 -10.35 0.000 ENI 0.08 0.174 0.44 0.663 PercentBlack -0.08 0.047 -1.79 0.074 PercentSWD -1.21 0.194 -6.27 0.000 PercentPoverty -0.68 0.172 -3.94 0.000 factor(borough)Brooklyn 0.01 0.030 0.44 0.663 factor(borough)Manhattan 0.17 0.036 4.73 0.000 factor(borough)Queens -0.11 0.034 -3.23 0.001 factor(borough)Staten Island -0.17 0.054 -3.10 0.002 2.1.4 Visualizing Inclusion in NYC 2.2 Question 2 2.2.1 Borough as Match Model We match at a ratio of 3:1, control:treatment groups. The original sample has 885 Control (no inclusion) schools and 240 Treatment (inclusion) schools. The matched sample has 418 Control and 181 Treatment. All covariates cross the acceptable standardized mean difference threshold, and visual diagnostics of the covariate distributions confirm the balance improvement. 2.2.1.1 Balance Diagnostics #&gt; Call #&gt; matchit(formula = treatment ~ PercentBlack + PercentSWD + PercentPoverty + #&gt; TotalEnrollment + ENI + borough, data = merged, method = &quot;nearest&quot;, #&gt; caliper = 0.25, ratio = 3, family = binomial()) #&gt; #&gt; Balance Measures #&gt; Type Diff.Adj M.Threshold #&gt; distance Distance 0.0705 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; PercentBlack Contin. -0.0823 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; PercentSWD Contin. -0.0316 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; PercentPoverty Contin. -0.0453 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; TotalEnrollment Contin. -0.0044 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; ENI Contin. -0.0264 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; borough_Bronx Binary 0.0056 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; borough_Brooklyn Binary -0.0009 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; borough_Manhattan Binary 0.0056 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; borough_Queens Binary -0.0158 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; borough_Staten Island Binary 0.0056 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; #&gt; Balance tally for mean differences #&gt; count #&gt; Balanced, &lt;0.1 11 #&gt; Not Balanced, &gt;0.1 0 #&gt; #&gt; Variable with the greatest mean difference #&gt; Variable Diff.Adj M.Threshold #&gt; PercentBlack -0.0823 Balanced, &lt;0.1 #&gt; #&gt; Sample sizes #&gt; Control Treated #&gt; All 885. 240 #&gt; Matched (ESS) 291.72 179 #&gt; Matched (Unweighted) 374. 179 #&gt; Unmatched 511. 61 2.2.1.2 Outcome Model \\[ \\begin{align} ChronicAbsenteeism = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1Treatment + BoroughFixedEffects + \\epsilon \\end{align} \\] Table 2.6: Borough as Match Model, IPTW estimates of the ATE Predictor B SE t p (Intercept) 31.49 0.818 38.49 0.000 treatment -2.47 0.718 -3.44 0.001 boroughBrooklyn -1.58 0.970 -1.63 0.103 boroughManhattan -7.13 1.131 -6.31 0.000 boroughQueens -11.59 1.041 -11.13 0.000 boroughStaten Island -8.12 1.988 -4.09 0.000 2.2.2 Within Borough Matching Model 2.2.2.1 Balance Diagnostics Not shown here, but balance achieved for 4/5 boroughs.
