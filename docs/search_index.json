Q2: What is the effect of inclusion on overall school attendance and chronic absenteeism in NYC public schools? 2.1 Question 1 2.1.1 Data Overview Using OpenData NYC, we pull aggregate K-8 attendance records and socio-economic variables for all 1125 public schools.

However, five covariates generally associated with higher absenteeism are predictive of both the treatment and the outcome, making them confounders. \\[ \\begin{align} ChronicAbsenteeism = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1Treatment + \\beta_2ENI+ \\beta_3PercentBlack+\\beta_4PercentSWD + \\\\ \\beta_5PercentPoverty +\\beta_6PercentPoverty+ BoroughFixedEffects + \\epsilon \\end{align} \\] Table 2.4: Chronic Absenteeism ~ Treatment + Covariates Predictor B SE t p (Intercept) 1.78 1.692 1.05 0.293 treatment -1.88 0.684 -2.75 0.006 TotalEnrollment 0.00 0.001 -3.97 0.000 ENI 43.59 3.981 10.95 0.000 PercentBlack 16.62 1.068 15.56 0.000 PercentSWD 36.88 4.501 8.19 0.000 PercentPoverty -20.36 3.960 -5.14 0.000 factor(borough)Brooklyn -3.76 0.683 -5.51 0.000 factor(borough)Manhattan -2.58 0.831 -3.10 0.002 factor(borough)Queens -2.62 0.788 -3.33 0.001 factor(borough)Staten Island 1.22 1.248 0.98 0.330 \\[ \\begin{align} Treatment = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1TotalEnrollment + \\beta_2ENI+ \\beta_3PercentBlack+\\beta_4PercentSWD + \\\\ \\beta_5PercentPoverty + BoroughFixedEffects + \\epsilon \\end{align} \\] Table 2.5: Treatment ~ Covariates Predictor B SE t p (Intercept) 1.19 0.065 18.27 0.000 TotalEnrollment 0.00 0.000 -10.35 0.000 ENI 0.08 0.174 0.44 0.663 PercentBlack -0.08 0.047 -1.79 0.074 PercentSWD -1.21 0.194 -6.27 0.000 PercentPoverty -0.68 0.172 -3.94 0.000 factor(borough)Brooklyn 0.01 0.030 0.44 0.663 factor(borough)Manhattan 0.17 0.036 4.73 0.000 factor(borough)Queens -0.11 0.034 -3.23 0.001 factor(borough)Staten Island -0.17 0.054 -3.10 0.002 2.1.4 Visualizing Inclusion in NYC 2.2 Question 2 2.2.1 Borough as Match Model We match at a ratio of 3:1, control:treatment groups. The original sample has 885 Control (no inclusion) schools and 240 Treatment (inclusion) schools. The matched sample has 418 Control and 181 Treatment.
